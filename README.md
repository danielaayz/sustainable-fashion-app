## Design

* Colour palette - We all came up with similar colour palettes for this, aiming for some sort of soft cotton/linen type colours, gentle greens to help encourage the idea that the site is environmentally/sustainability focused and perhaps some soft pinks.

It's quite reminiscent of Scandinavian style and is widely recognised as such outside of Europe. This also adds to the idea that we are also environmentally conscious by utilising that connection.

 * Inspiration - Here are some pages that we felt resonated with our ideas based off our goal end-user:

### Accessibility

Accessibility plans:

* Semantic HTML
* Descriptive alt text for images
* Ensure good colour contrast for visually impaired users with [Colour Contrast Analyzer](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/)
* Colour blindness: I did some research on the most common types of colour blindness and found a colour palette that works well for almost everyone!

### Imagery

The imagery comes from free image resources.

### Wireframes

## Features

The website consists of several key pages:

* Homepage - A welcoming landing page to inspire visitors!
* About - A concise overview of the company, its' morals and goals with the site.
* Clothing overview - unauthenticated users can still have access to see user's clothing submissions (annonymously) in order to gain knowledge about clothing articles.
* User registration - anyone can create an account to engage in different ways with the content. There are measures in place to ensure no two users can have the same email or username, and that the password is of sufficient strength.
* User login/out - the user can choose to log in or out of the website. Logged-in users have access to create and view their personal wardrobes.
* Editing submissions - Authenticated users can also edit their wardrobe articles at any time by visiting their profile and viewing their wardrobe, then clicking edit on any item of choice. This will redirect them to the create wardrobe item page but with the prepopulated form data from their original submission.

## Local Development

#### How to Fork


Should you wish to fork this repo, here is a guide on how to do that:


Firstly, go to https://github.com/danielaayz/sustainable-fashion-app


1. On the main repo page, click the Fork button near the top right corner
![fork_step_1]()


2. On the create a fork page, check the Owner of the repo is set to the GitHub org you wish to use, and change the name of the repo if you wish.

	2a: Add a description if you want to.

3. Check the box here if you want to make a copy of the main branch or multiple branches (main is selected by default).

4. Create the fork. The screenshot is from an old project as I cannot fork my Python project due to not having any organizations connected to my account, and presumably because this repo is already a fork of the CI template.
 
 ![fork_step_4]()


#### How to Clone
  

For cloning the repo you will need:

* The [repo]() open
 

* Your IDE of choice

1. On the repo page, click on the green "Code" button

2. On the dropdown from the Code button, click on your chosen key (pictured here is SSH)

3. Click the copy button (shown as two squares on top of one another) 

![clone-step-3]()


4. Open your IDE of choice and open the Terminal, or in my case, open the Terminal on your computer (I run Linux on Windows so may be slightly different for Mac/Windows users)

5. Check that you're in the right folder (shown here by checking my current folder by using the input: ls

6. Change as needed to reach your desired folder.

7. Type (without quotation marks): "git clone" followed by your copied link from GitHub.
  
  ![clone-step-7]()

8. You can now access the repo in your IDE if cloned directly there, or by typing (without quotation marks) "code ." in your Terminal.

9. Enjoy!
